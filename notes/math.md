### Functions

- An equation will be a function if, for any $x$ in the domain of the equation, the equation wil yield exactly one value of $y$ when we evaluate the equation at a specific $x$
- The domain is all the $x$'s that can be plugged into the equation

- Function notation: writing the $y$ in a function in a way that will allow us to simplify notation and some of our work
- Example: $y = 2x^2 - 5x + 3$ can be written as $f(x) = 2x^2 - 5x + 3$, $h(x) = 2x^2 - 5x + 3$, $R(x) = 2x^2 - 5x + 3$, etc.  using the function notation
- Function notation gives us a nice compact way of representing function values
- Using function notation we represent the value of the function at $x = −3$ as $f(−3)
- _How do we actually evaluate the function?_ :arrow_right: Everywhere we see an $x$ on the right side we will substitute whatever is in the parenthesis on the left side
- For our function this gives: $f(-3) = 2(-3)^2 - 5(-3) + 3 = 2(9) + 15 + 3 = 36$

- A root of a function is a number for which the function is zero
- In other words, finding the roots of a function, $g(x)$, is equivalent to solving $g(x) = 0$

- The domain of a function is the set of all values that can be plugged into a function and have the function exist and have a real number for a value
- So, for the domain we need to avoid division by zero, square roots of negative numbers, logarithms of zero and logarithms of negative numbers
- The range of a function is simply the set of all possible values that a function can take

### Limits

- Limits describe how a function behaves near a point, instead of at that point
- This simple yet powerful idea is the basis of all calculus

- Example function $f$:

```math
f(x) = \frac{x - 1}{x - 1} \Rightarrow f(x) = 1, x \neq 1
```

- Undefined for $x = 1$ :left_right_arrow: $f(1)$ undefined
- _What is the function approaching as x equals 1?_
  - $\lim_{x \to 1} f(x) = 1$
  - $\lim_{1 \to x} f(x) = 1$

- Example function $g$:

```math
g(x) = 
\begin{cases}
  x^2, &x \neq 2\\
  1, &x = 2
\end{cases}
```

- _What is the limit as x approaches 2 of g of x?_
  - $\lim_{x \to 2} g(x) = 4$
  - $\lim_{2 \to x} g(x) = 4$
